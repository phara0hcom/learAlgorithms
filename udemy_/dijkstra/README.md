# Dijkstra Algorithm

One of the most famous and widely used algorithms around! Finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph. "What's the fastest way to get from point A to point B?"

## Dijkstra

**Edsger Dijkstra** was a Dutch programmer, physicist, essayist, and all around smarty-pants. He helped to advance the field of computer science from an "art" to an academic discipline. Many of his discoveries and algorithms are still commonly used to this day.

His main pioneering contributions (including ideas, inventions and innovations) include:

- **Algorithms:** Dijkstra's algorithm, DJP algorithm, Dijkstra-Scholten algorithm, Dekker's algorithm (generalization), banker's algorithm, smooth-sort, shunting-yard algorithm, tri-color marking algorithm, concurrent algorithms, distributed algorithms, deadlock prevention algorithms, mutual exclusion algorithms, self-stabilizing algorithms
- **Concepts, methods, principles and theories:** ALGOL 60 implementation, call stack, concurrency, concurrent programming, cooperating sequential processes, critical section, deadly embrace (deadlock), dining philosophers problem, Dutch national flag problem, fault-tolerant systems, goto-less programming, guarded command language (guarded commands), layered structure in software architecture, levels of abstraction, multi-threaded programming, mutual exclusion (mutex or lock), producer–consumer problem (bounded buffer problem), program families, predicate transformer semantics, process synchronization, self-stabilizing distributed systems (self-stabilization), semaphore, separation of concerns, sleeping barber problem, structured analysis, structured programming, THE multiprogramming system, unbounded nondeterminism, weakest precondition calculus

> What is the shortest way to travel from Rotterdam to Groningen, in general: from given city to given city. It is the algorithm for the shortest path, which I designed in about twenty minutes. One morning I was shopping in Amsterdam with my young fiancée, and tired, we sat down on the café terrace to drink a cup of coffee and I was just thinking about whether I could do this, and I then designed the algorithm for the shortest path. As I said, it was a twenty-minute invention. Eventually that algorithm became, to my great amazement, one of the cornerstones of my fame.

## Why

- GPS - finding fastest route
- Network Routing - finds open shortest path for data
- Biology - used to model the spread of viruses among humans
- Airline tickets - finding cheapest route to your destination
- Many other uses!
